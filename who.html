    <p>Most of us do not have to think twice about this question.
      <i>We know!</i> Our whole life and thinking was centered in drugs
      in one form or anotherâ€”the getting and using and finding
      ways and means to get more. We lived to use and used
      to live. Very simply, an addict is a man or woman whose
      life is controlled by drugs. We are people in the grip of a
      continuing and progressive illness whose ends are always
      the same: jails, institutions, and death.
