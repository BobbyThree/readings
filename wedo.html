    <p>When at the end of the road we find that we can no longer
      function as a human being, either with or without drugs, we all
      face the same dilemma. What is there left to do? There seems
      to be this alternative: either go on as best we can to the bitter
      ends—jails, institutions or death—or find a new way to live. In
      years gone by, very few addicts ever had this last choice.
      Those who are addicted today are more fortunate. For the first
      time in man's entire history, a simple way has been proving
      itself in the lives of many addicts. It is available to us all. This is
      a simple spiritual—not religious—program, known as Narcotics
      Anonymous.</p>
