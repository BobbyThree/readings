    <p>
      We keep what we have only with vigilance, and just as
      freedom for the individual comes from the Twelve Steps, so
      freedom for the group springs from our Traditions.
      As long as the ties that bind us together are stronger than
      those that would tear us apart, all will be well.<br>
    </p>
      
      <ol type="1">
      <li>Our common welfare should come first; personal recovery
      depends on NA unity.</li>
      <li>For our group purpose there is but one ultimate authority—
      a loving God as He may express Himself in our group
      conscience. Our leaders are but trusted servants; they do
      not govern.</li>
      <li>The only requirement for membership is a desire to stop using.</li>
      <li>Each group should be autonomous except in matters
      affecting other groups or NA as a whole.</li>
      <li>Each group has but one primary purpose—to carry the
      message to the addict who still suffers.</li>
      <li>An NA group ought never endorse, finance, or lend the NA
      name to any related facility or outside enterprise, lest
      problems of money, property, or prestige divert us from our
      primary purpose.</li>
      <li>Every NA group ought to be fully self-supporting, declining
      outside contributions.</li>
      <li>Narcotics Anonymous should remain forever nonprofessional,
      but our service centers may employ special workers.</li>
      <li>NA, as such, ought never be organized, but we may create
      service boards or committees directly responsible to those
      they serve.</li>
      <li>Narcotics Anonymous has no opinion on outside issues; hence
      the NA name ought never be drawn into public controversy.</li>
      <li>Our public relations policy is based on attraction rather than
      promotion; we need always maintain personal anonymity at
      the level of press, radio, and films.</li>
      <li>Anonymity is the spiritual foundation of all our Traditions,
      ever reminding us to place principles before personalities.<br>
    </ol>
    
    <p>
      Understanding these Traditions comes slowly over a period
      of time. We pick up information as we talk to members and visit
      various groups. It usually isn't until we get involved with service
      that someone points out that “personal recovery depends on
      NA unity,” and that unity depends on how well we follow our
      Traditions. The Twelve Traditions of NA are not negotiable.
      They are the guidelines that keep our Fellowship alive and free.
      By following these guidelines in our dealings with others,
      and society at large, we avoid many problems. That is not to
      say that our Traditions eliminate all problems. We still have to
      face difficulties as they arise: communication problems,
      differences of opinion, internal controversies, and troubles
      with individuals and groups outside the Fellowship. However,
      when we apply these principles, we avoid some of the pitfalls.
      Many of our problems are like those that our predecessors
      had to face. Their hard won experience gave birth to the
      Traditions, and our own experience has shown that these
      principles are just as valid today as they were when these
      Traditions were formulated. Our Traditions protect us from the
      internal and external forces that could destroy us. They are
      truly the ties that bind us together. It is only through
      understanding and application that they work.</p>
